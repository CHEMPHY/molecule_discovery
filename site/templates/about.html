    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>matter.farm is an open database that continually generates and publishes novel molecular structures that are potential drug candidates.</p>
    <p>Pharmacological space––or the space of possible molecules that are likely to have pharmacological activity––is vast. Some estimates place it at 10<sup>60</sup> to 10<sup>63</sup> possible distinct molecular structures.</p>
    <p>matter.farm aims to delineate and publish as much of this space as possible and it also makes potential synthesis routes available to enable researchers and others to produce and test the molecules matter.farm generates. matter.farm is a non-commercial entity and the information matter.farm publishes is free and open to the public, to researchers, and to manufacturers. matter.farm does not lay any claim of ownership to the molecular structures it publishes. In  many jurisdictions of patent law, the structures will become “prior art” or “background art” from the date of their publication. As a result, the structures published by matter.farm may not be able to be patented by other entities. (This information is not intended as legal advice.)</p>
    <p>Each molecule that is generated by matter.farm is checked against the <a href="http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">PubChem database</a> to determine if it is novel at the time of publication. Molecular structures that exist in PubChem at the time that they are generated and checked by matter.farm are not published. matter.farm intends to only publish novel structures. However, researchers, manufacturers and others should do their own search to determine whether any particular structure is claimed by a patent of another entity. Additionally, molecular structures that do not appear in Pubchem but that exist elsewhere in literature or in the world, may be published by matter.farm though they are not in fact novel. matter.farm makes no warranty that its information is correct and is not liable for any damages that may result from the use of its site and information (see <a href="/">Terms of Use</a> for more information).</p>
    <p>The current version of matter.farm, launched in 2018 focuses on small molecule ligands, primarily following the Lipinski rule. Future versions may include biologics and other areas.</p>
    <h2>Using matter.farm</h2>
    <p>Each molecular structure generated by matter.farm is timestamped with its date of publication (or “Birthday”). For ease of use, molecules are grouped under the human receptors, enzymes and other therapeutic targets that matter.farm’s algorithm determines them to be most likely to activate (or inhibit). However, researchers, manufacturers and others should consider all other possible, relevant targets for a given molecule––the target a molecule is listed under as well as types of activation (e.g. agonist, antagonist, etc.) are meant as guidelines to assist in finding the structures on matter.farm. They are not intended to be limiting as to the potential therapeutic uses of a structure.</p>
    <p>matter.farm also includes a predicted ATC (<a href="https://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/">Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification</a>) code for each entry for ease of use. As with the listed receptor and enzyme targets, these ATC codes should not be construed as being limiting to the potential therapeutic uses. All other potentially relevant uses should also be considered.</p>
    <p>The entry for each molecular structure also includes a unique identifier and a SMILES string pertaining to the structure.</p>
    <p>Clicking on the entry will lead to a page showing a 3-dimensional, interactive view of the structure.</p>
    <p>At the bottom of each entry is a link to a potential synthesis plan to produce the molecule. This may not be the most efficient or cost-effective route. Other synthesis routes should be given consideration.</p>
